## NVim notes

Remember to install language servers for the configured languages, or the configuration for new ones. Check here: https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/CONFIG.md

For telescope, remember to install both 

ripgrep - https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
fdfind/fd (symlink to fd) - https://github.com/sharkdp/fd#installation

For treesitter, check lua config if more languages are needed
